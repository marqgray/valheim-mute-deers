# Silent Deers

This project is a fork of https://github.com/marqgray/valheim-better-wolves

This mod was modified upon request specifically for deers. Constant deer bleats are silenced by default and configurable. Deers will stake make a sound when they are alerted to a predator's presence, but it is once and nothing nearly as constant.



This mod will not receive any new feature updates. This mod may be incorporated into a larger mod of mine with new features and changes in the future.
